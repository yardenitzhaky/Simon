# Simon Game

A web-based implementation of the classic Simon memory game.

## About the Game

This project is a recreation of the classic Simon game, where players must remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. Test your memory and see how many levels you can complete!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key or click the "Start" button to begin.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: Pay attention to the sequence of flashing colors and sounds.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click the buttons in the same order as the sequence.
4. **Progress**: With each correct sequence, you'll advance to the next level, and the sequence will get longer.
5. **Game Over**: If you make a mistake, the game ends. Press any key or the "Restart" button to try again.
   ```bash
